# Maestro

Maestro is a bot for the popular online service, Discord. This was (and technically is) a fun personal project to add whatever features came to mind, and gain some knowledge of async operations and using APIs in the process.
The project began in 2017, with most work being done during 2018 and early 2019. It was previously stored on bitbucket, but I moved it to github to be with my other projects. It is a node application that uses Discord.js to communicate with the platform and is capable of a few major features:

Features:  
Dice rolls! (Both six-sided and d20)  
Weather! (This uses openweathermap.org's API to pull accurate weather information on any(ish) location)  
Youtube streaming! (This is the main function of the bot - you can queue multiple tracks, and play tracks via url or search terms)  
Random message! (Currently only fetches from the last 100 messages, working on improving this one)  
Play a laugh track! (This one is silly. Save it for your highest quality jokes)
